#Progress Pledge Prototype

![](http://i.imgur.com/wTy9lGh.png)

Aw yiss, it's [an online demo](http://back.nothingtohide.cc/), and the [full source on Github](https://github.com/nutcasenightmare/progress-pledge)!

**Top-Left**: Campaign progress bar. Shows how much is pledged per milestone.    
**Bottom-Left**: Pledging form. Select total pledge amount, and per-milestone split.    
**Top-Right**: Backer sees this page displaying their pledge progress.    
**Bottom-Right**: Admin dashboard with overall stats, and links to claim pledges.

I'm pretty proud of my progress on this pledging prototype! (Ain't alliterations awesome?)
Everything listed above is fully functional\*, and actually calls Stripe to bill credit cards.
All that's left to do is testing, polish, and adding the actual content (text/video) for the *Nothing To Hide* campaign.

**Next week**: Do user tests, add polish. (Stretch goal: create campaign content.)

\* *A reader has pointed out that this was not a true fact.
The Paypal & Coinbase options are currently still unimplemented. Thanks for the correction, Allen!*

#Nothing To Hide

Nothing to show for *Nothing to Hide* this week. But I did finally push all the latest unpublished work
on the game to [a messy Github repo](https://github.com/nutcasenightmare/nothing-to-hide).
It's not clean, it's not organized, but it's *everything*.

This week, I hope to actually do what I set out to do last week.

**This week**: Create a polished vertical.
A cutscene leads into an in-game level, with polished mouse-based controls,
a fully animated world, new levels to show off the new mechanics, and a great background soundtrack.
Publish this for feedback.

Meeting again with the Mozilla YVR team was a blast!
They let me demo my projects, Nothing To Hide and Progress Pledges.
(A shout-out to [Angelina](https://twitter.com/angelinamagnum) for lending me a Firefox OS to help port Nothing To Hide!)
The demo was also an effective way to find each project's "oh wow that's cool" moment.
(Nothing To Hide: anti-stealth. Progress Pledge: pledging in instalments)

On my way out, I walked into a door and started bleeding, somehow.    
Sorry for staining the floor.

**Until next time,**

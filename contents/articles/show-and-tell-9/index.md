The first developer vlog entry from Nothing To Hide!
A picture is worth a thousand words, so this video must be worth 24,000 words per second.
The math checks out.

**Storytelling, and tragicomedy.**

*“In the last photograph, he is screaming so hard it looks as if he is laughing”.*    
~ Men Who Stare At Goats, describing a photo of 'enhanced interrogation'.

The biggest feature added has been the intro cutscene in the form of a scrollable social media feed.
People love the clever presentation of it!
The introduction sets the scene. You're an insecure teenage girl, running away from your emotionally neglectful father.
Who's also a big politician.
A tragic setting, told through a comic lens. I love writing tragicomedy.

**Playtesting, and accidental obscurity**

After three in-person playtests, (Katriona, MC, and Thomas) and sending the latest build
[to my TinyLetter subscribers](http://tinyletter.com/nothingtohide/letters/a-late-present-to-you-from-nothing-to-hide)
and [the r/gamedev community](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1tsuec/feedback_friday_61/ceb3a9o),
and [again to r/gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1tv1x1/screenshot_saturday_151_2013/cebqfpr)...
I notice a few recurring sentiments.

* Mixed reception on mouse controls. Some *love* it, some want arrow keys back.
* Add in-game instructions before publishing a playable build, dummy.
* It takes too long to establish the main mechanic.

On the plus side...

* The crowd goes *wild* for "Story through a Social Feed"!

**Next Steps, and *cutting down everything*.**

* Playtest new control scheme: Keyboard control, *with a sneak mode for precise movement*.
Movement precision was the only reason I made mouse controls in the first place.
* Combine and cull levels: Establish the "you must keep yourself in sight" premise from the get-go.
Moving iEyes should be the second level. The next three levels expanding on moving iEyes should be combined into one level.
Conveyor levels were well-received, and can stay the same. The Trigger-Eyes mechanic needs to be introduced better.
* Story: Cut out a lot of the bigger story I had planned. It's bloat anyway. 
Create the ending cutscene.
Minimum Viable Story: You're an insecure girl in a nation obsessed with security. You go on the run.
You rescue another runaway kid just like you, who's part of a rebellion. You join him. To be continued.

I will kick myself screaming if I do not finish this game by *Friday, Jan 3rd, 2014*.
Screaming so hard, that looks like I'm laughing.

**Until next time,**

<p>Three months ago, I published 
<em><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/07/so-you-wanna-build-a-crowdfunding-site/">So You Want To Build A Crowdfunding Site?</a></em>
on the Mozilla Hacks blog. 
It&#39;s a tutorial for making a basic crowdfunding site using Node.js <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Balanced,
and the demo website&#39;s source code is readily forkable on&nbsp;Github.</p>
<p>Initially, my only goal for this week was to prototype a ‚Äúcrowdfunding with baked-in accountability‚Äù website.
But because of the aforementioned tutorial, I just copied my old code, made small modifications, and my Progress Pledge prototype was complete.
Only took one day. Not a good weekly goal, in&nbsp;hindsight.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/33MJGqu.png" alt="&quot;progress pledge prototype pic&quot;"></p>
<p>If you&#39;re wondering who Casey Cat is, I have a list of Placeholder Pets I use whenever I prototype a new thing.
Other Placeholder Pets include Dance Monkey, Tiger Durden, and Lauren Ipsum, the quick brown&nbsp;fox.</p>
<p>The next logical step would be to turn this prototype into an actual crowdfunding campaign.
All I needed now was a guinea pig - what would the campaign be going towards?
Because this is about baked-in accountability in crowdfunding,
I needed to test this on a medium-sized project that would take at least a few months to complete.
I thought about the myriad of previouds projects I&#39;ve dropped for some reason or other,
and decided I would resurrect my relatively recent game&nbsp;project:</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
    <b>Nothing to Hide, Nothing to Fear</b>
    <br>
    a surveillance state survival horror
    <br><br>
</div>


<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Koa73xv.png" alt="&quot;nothing to hide campaign&quot;"></p>
<p>By the way, I was pretty happy with that background.
At 1280x800, it makes a great desktop wallpaper too!
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/uLBroAh.png">Here you go, a <span class="caps">CC</span> Zero licensed wallpaper.</a>
I hope you have a 1280x800&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>In an ambition-fueled frenzy, I said, you know what? 
The <a href="https://rally.stopwatching.us/">StopWatching.Us</a> rally is on October 26<span class="ord">th</span>. Halloween is October 31<span class="ord">st</span>.
If I go into crunch time for the next couple weeks,
I could create a small polished demo of what the full game could be, and launch my crowdfunding campaign at the end of this&nbsp;month!</p>
<p>And crunch time I&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>I went from&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qBccRAG.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dn3SStS.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To finally&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0BF4GjG.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All in the span of the last five&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Of course, crunch time&#39;s not healthy to do for too long at a stretch.
I&#39;m not trying to paint myself as a martyr for my work, because past some point, I was so tired I was unproductively scatterbrained.
It was <em>hurting</em> my work. That might be one reason why the alpha is still&nbsp;incomplete.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m taking this weekend off to unwind. Maybe do a bit of casual writing like I&#39;m doing now.
Next week, I&#39;ll try to stick to a proper schedule. Sleep early, wake early, <em>and force myself to take breaks</em>.
(No, browsing through Hacker News or Reddit does not&nbsp;count.)</p>
<p>Speaking of which, here are my next week&#39;s&nbsp;goals.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Goal: Show <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Tell blog for Nothing to&nbsp;Hide.</strong></p>
<p>I want <em>Nothing To Hide&#39;s</em> development to be completely open and transparent.
I&#39;m going to start with a Show <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Tell blog for it, and post my progress there.
(Such as the above sections and&nbsp;screenshots!)</p>
<p>In the future, I&#39;d like to post more than just progress there.
I want to also open up discussions on designing the game itself,
tutorials for aspiring gamedevs,
and my personal stories of having lived half my life in Singapore, the most Orwellian <em>developed</em> country I know&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>Making this Show <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Tell blog should take less than a day.
After all, like the progress pledge prototype, I just need to take the existing code of the ncase.me website,
make slight modifications, and publish&nbsp;it!</p>
<p><strong>Goal: Playable beta for Nothing To&nbsp;Hide.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, <em>Nothing to Hide</em> is in half-alpha.
Specifically, I&#39;ve got most of the game engine, game mechanics, and story down for now.
My game engine lets me create and modify levels very simply, by just modifying a <span class="caps">JSON</span> file in any text editor.
A very, <em>very</em> barebones level&nbsp;editor.</p>
<p>What&#39;s left to do is to actually <em>use</em> that level editor to create all the damn levels.
Oh, and replace all the art and textures with actual art,
because the only real art in the game so far is the redhead tomboy character.
<em>That&#39;s my standard for playable beta.</em>
All levels and art are more or less finalized, and all that&#39;s left to do is polish <span class="amp">&amp;</span> bug&nbsp;fixing.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NxrzdpI.gif" alt="&quot;tomboy walk cycle&quot;"></p>
<p>I haven&#39;t decided on the main character&#39;s name yet.<br>Let&#39;s call her Red Panda for&nbsp;now.</p>

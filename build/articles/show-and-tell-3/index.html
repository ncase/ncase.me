<p><strong>Accomplished: Show <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Tell blog for Nothing to&nbsp;Hide.</strong></p>
<p>Check out <em>Nothing To Hide</em>&#39;s new site at <a href="http://nothingtohide.cc/">NothingToHide.cc!</a></p>

<p>My original plan was to
‚Äú<em>take the existing code of the ncase.me website, make slight modifications, and publish it</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p>I went further.
<em>Everything</em> had to be&nbsp;open.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> instead of Google Analytics, because I don&#39;t want Google (and <span class="caps">PRISM</span>) tracking my viewers.
I used <a href="https://github.com/phusion/juvia">Juvia</a> instead of Disqus for comments, because of privacy concerns with Disqus.
Both Piwik and Juvia are as fully-featured as their proprietary counterparts,
and in some aspects, they&#39;re actually better!
Soon, I&#39;ll give this <span class="caps">NCASE</span> Show <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Tell blog the same open&nbsp;treatment.</p>
<p>The best part? Doing all this was <em>easy</em>.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t take much to escape the grasp of centralized services,
thanks to <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, an open-source PaaS.
OpenShift has this great feature called Quickstart, which lets you create a new, self-hosted app in minutes.
As luck would have it, a <a href="https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/juvia-example">Juvia Quickstart</a>
and a <a href="https://github.com/openshift/piwik-openshift-quickstart">Piwik Quickstart</a> already&nbsp;exist.</p>
<p>That was a fun day of exploring new open source tech.<br>Followed by a few days of scrambling over Nothing To&nbsp;Hide.</p>

<p><strong>Failed: Playable beta for Nothing to&nbsp;Hide.</strong></p>
<p>First, the good news. I&#39;ve done quite a bit of work on <em>Nothing To Hide</em> this week,
and right now, it both looks and sounds <em>awesome</em>.
Here&#39;s a gameplay&nbsp;<span class="caps">GIF</span>:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BljOvAV.gif" alt="&quot;Gameplay GIF&quot;"></p>
<p>The bad news is this is still nowhere close to &#39;playable beta&#39;, at least by my&nbsp;definition.</p>
<p>Although I&#39;ve been making great progress on <em>Nothing To Hide</em> in the last couple weeks,
I&#39;m still failing at the goals I set out.
I had planned to finish the alpha by last week, and failed.
What did I do then? I set a new goal to complete the <em>beta</em> by this week, and again, failed.
My plan was still to launch the demo and campaign before the <a href="https://rally.stopwatching.us/">Stop Watching Us</a> rally.
Which is&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>I <em>might</em> be underestimating how much time I&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>But as I like to say, every bomb has a silver lining.
By recording and recognizing the gap between my goals and achievements, I get better at planning projects.
Drastically scaling back, here is my one, small, realistic goal for the upcoming&nbsp;week.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Goal: In-browser playable tutorial for Nothing to Hide by&nbsp;Halloween.</strong></p>
<p>My previous goals for <em>Nothing To Hide</em> were vague, like &#39;finish alpha&#39; or &#39;finish beta&#39;.
Not this goal. Here&#39;s the specific criteria for what I want accomplished by Halloween, and why.
It&#39;s in a <em>numbered</em> list, which as we all know, is the most serious of&nbsp;lists.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a polished tutorial</strong>, to show off mainly the mechanics and art style.
Story should be minimal, and only hinted&nbsp;at.</li>
<li><strong>Playtest the full tutorial in person, thrice.</strong>
I have quite a few roommates in this hacker house who have not seen <em>Nothing To Hide</em>&nbsp;yet.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the game works cross-browser.</strong>
While the final game will most likely be a downloadable, this is important just for the next few&nbsp;steps.</li>
<li><strong>Share it online on Halloween morning.</strong>
Specifically, a Newgrounds frontpage news post, r/gamedev&#39;s Feedback Friday, my social media, and maybe a few forums.
<em>Emphasize it is a polished prototype, not even an&nbsp;alpha.</em></li>
<li><strong>Get feedback, attention, and possible collaborators.</strong>
Invite people to sign up for my newsletter for updates,
and make an open call for other artists to team up with. (one musician and one voice&nbsp;actress?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Mmm. Making numbered lists sure helps create a false sense of productivity!
All I need now is to set my desktop background to a &#39;motivational&#39;&nbsp;picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gIKdChb.jpg" alt="&quot;Ship, you fool&quot;"></p>
<p>Yeah, that&nbsp;works.</p>

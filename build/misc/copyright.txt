Hey there, I'm NutcaseNightmare. (now simply NCASE)
I'm the creator of the :The Game: trilogy of satirical web games,
as well as Gap Monsters, Pony Wings, Secret Santa, Nothing To Hide,
and a bunch of other Flash/HTML5 games.

It's absolutely ridiculous I have to state this explicitly, but here goes:

1. You can monetize Let's Plays of my games.
2. You are free to share and re-distribute my web games.
3. YOU CAN MONETIZE LET'S PLAYS OF MY GAMES.
4. You are free to make derivatives/parodies of my creations.
5. YOU CAN MONETIZE. LET'S PLAYS. OF MY GAMES.

Special thanks to SirTapTap (http://www.youtube.com/user/SirTapTap)
for first bringing to my attention that YouTube now requires an explicit
copyright notice allowing Let's Plays, thanks to draconian copyright laws.
